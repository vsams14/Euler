Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

n + n + 41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values 
n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible 
by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula  n - 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes 
for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the coefficients, -79 and 
1601, is -126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:

n + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000

where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
e.g. |11| = 11 and |-4| = 4
Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that 
produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with 
n = 0.
